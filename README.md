This is simple foreign exchange application. You can see basic api usage with axios library in react-native. 
For UI I used native-base components. For more lovely native-base components please see : https://docs.nativebase.io/
In the project I  indicate how to develop for more interesting result. This is only created to show how to make get request and interpret data in project.
